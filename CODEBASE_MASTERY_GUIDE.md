## üèóÔ∏è **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **What We're Building**
SymbioFlows is an **AI-powered industrial symbiosis marketplace** that connects companies to exchange waste, energy, and resources. It's essentially a "LinkedIn for industrial waste" where AI identifies profitable reuse opportunities.

### **Core Problem Solved**
Industrial waste costs companies billions annually. SymbioFlows uses advanced AI to identify where one company's waste can become another's raw material, creating economic and environmental value.
