# GNN Engine Production Checklist

## 1. Model Architecture & Flexibility
- [x] Multiple GNN architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, R-GCN) implemented
- [x] Modular, extensible code for adding new architectures
- [x] Configurable hyperparameters (layers, heads, dropout, etc.)

## 2. Data Handling & Preprocessing
- [ ] Conversion from industrial data/NetworkX to PyG Data objects
- [ ] One-hot/categorical encoding and normalization for all features
- [ ] Handling of missing/unknown data gracefully
- [ ] Support for large graphs (batching, graph partitioning, memory management)
- [ ] Automated data validation and schema enforcement

## 3. Training & Inference
- [ ] Positive/negative edge sampling for link prediction
- [ ] Support for supervised training
- [ ] Support for unsupervised/self-supervised training (e.g., node2vec, contrastive learning)
- [ ] Model training with loss tracking and logging
- [ ] Early stopping, checkpointing, and best model selection
- [ ] Batch inference and async support for high throughput
- [ ] Model versioning and reproducibility (save/load models, random seeds)

## 4. Advanced Features
- [ ] Greedy algorithm baseline for link prediction
- [ ] Explainable AI (feature importance, link explanations, attention visualization)
- [ ] Uncertainty estimation/confidence scoring for predictions
- [ ] Multi-hop reasoning and path explanations (beyond direct links)
- [ ] Integration with knowledge graph for real-time updates

## 5. API & Service Layer
- [ ] RESTful/async API endpoints for inference, health, and model management
- [ ] Input validation and error handling at the API layer
- [ ] Authentication, rate limiting, and logging for API usage
- [ ] Caching and result reuse (e.g., Redis)

## 6. Productionization
- [ ] Containerization (Docker) with minimal, secure images
- [ ] Automated tests (unit, integration, e2e) with high coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for build, test, deploy
- [ ] Observability: Prometheus metrics, Jaeger tracing, structured logs
- [ ] Resource limits and auto-scaling (K8s-ready)

## 7. Documentation & Usability
- [ ] Docstrings and inline documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive README and API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Example requests, responses, and usage patterns
- [ ] Architecture diagrams and data flow charts
- [ ] Clear instructions for local and production deployment
