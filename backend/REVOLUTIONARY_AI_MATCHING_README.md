   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from revolutionary_ai_matching import RevolutionaryAIMatching

async def generate_matches():
    # Initialize the system
    ai_matching = RevolutionaryAIMatching()
    
    # Generate matches
    source_material = "Recycled Aluminum"
    source_type = "metal"
    source_company = "EcoMetals Inc."
    
    matches = await ai_matching.generate_high_quality_matches(
        source_material, source_type, source_company
    )
    
    # Process matches
    for match in matches:
        print(f"Match: {match['target_company_name']} - Score: {match['match_score']:.2f}")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(generate_matches())
```

### Testing

Run the test script to verify that the system is working correctly:

```bash
python test_revolutionary_ai_matching.py
```

3. **Hyperdimensional Computing**: Represents materials in high-dimensional vector spaces
4. **Advanced Graph Neural Networks**: Models complex relationships between materials
5. **Semantic Reasoning Engine**: Understands material properties and applications
6. **Market Intelligence Integration**: Incorporates real-time market data
7. **Sustainability Optimization**: Prioritizes environmentally friendly matches
8. **API Integration Layer**: Connects to multiple external APIs for enhanced data

## API Reference

### `generate_high_quality_matches(source_material, source_type, source_company)`

Generates high-quality matches for the given source material.

- **Parameters**:
  - `source_material` (str): The name of the source material
  - `source_type` (str): The type of the source material (e.g., "metal", "plastic")
  - `source_company` (str): The name of the source company

- **Returns**:
  - List of match dictionaries, each containing:
    - `target_company_id`: Unique identifier for the target company
    - `target_company_name`: Name of the target company
    - `target_material_name`: Name of the target material
    - `target_material_type`: Type of the target material
    - `match_score`: Quality score for the match (0.0-1.0)
    - `match_type`: Type of match (e.g., "revolutionary_ai")
    - `potential_value`: Estimated potential value of the match
    - `revolutionary_features`: Detailed scores for various matching features
    - `api_integrations`: Data from integrated APIs

## Troubleshooting

- **API Connection Issues**: Ensure all API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file
- **Memory Errors**: The system uses advanced neural networks which may require significant RAM
- **GPU Acceleration**: For optimal performance, use a CUDA-compatible GPU
