## Week 1-2 — System Foundation
### Learning Goals
1. Understand the **business model** of industrial symbiosis.  
2. Map the **three-layer architecture** (Frontend · Backend · AI Services).  
3. Set up **local development** and run all core services.

### Key Concepts
| Layer | Tech Stack | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Frontend | React 18·TypeScript·Vite·Tailwind | User experience & real-time updates |
| Backend | Node.js 18·Express·Supabase | API gateway, auth, business logic |
| AI Services | Python 3·Flask micro-services | GNN, Federated Learning, Analytics |

### Architecture Walkthrough
```ascii
┌──────────────────┐      HTTP/WebSocket       ┌──────────────────┐
│  React Frontend  │  ─────────────────────▶  │  Node API Server │
└──────────────────┘                           └──────────────────┘
                                                       │
                                    Internal REST/RPC │
                                                       ▼
                                           ┌──────────────────────┐
                                           │  Python AI Services  │
                                           └──────────────────────┘
```

### Hands-On Lab
1. `git clone … && npm i && npm run dev` — verify frontend is live on **http://localhost:5173**.  
2. `cd backend && npm i && npm start` — hit **GET /api/health** and confirm `200 OK`.  
3. `cd ai_service_flask && pip install -r requirements.txt && python ai_gateway.py` — confirm **AI Gateway** is listening on **:5000**.

### Flash Cards (sample)
- **Q** What are the three main architectural layers of SymbioFlows?  
  **A** Frontend (React), Backend (Node/Express), AI Services (Python micro-services).
- **Q** Which database powers real-time subscriptions?  
  **A** Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector).

> **Full flash card list in Appendix A**

### Self-Test
1. Draw the high-level architecture from memory.  
2. Explain how WebSocket updates flow from Postgres ➜ Backend ➜ Frontend.

class AIGateway(Flask):
    def route_request(self, payload):
        svc = self.load_balancer.select(payload['task'])
        return self.forward_to_service(svc, payload)
```

### Lab — Build “SimilaritySearch” Service
